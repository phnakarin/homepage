Installation on Red Hat Linux
=============================

Varnish Cache is packaged in RPMs for easy installation and upgrade on Red Hat
systems. The Varnish Cache project maintains official packages for the current
Enterprise Linux versions. Varnish Cache 4.1 and 5.x are supported on EL6 and EL7.

Official packages of 5
----------------------

Starting from Varnish Cache 5.0, we've simplified our packaging down to two:
the main package and a development package.

The official Varnish Cache repository is now hosted at Packagecloud.io.
Instructions for installing the official repository which contains the newest 
Varnish Cache 5 release are available at:

* https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish5/install

For manual installation instructions, use the instructions under "Manual" and
+select "rpm" for RPM-based distributions.

Official packages of 4.1
------------------------

To use Varnish Cache 4.1 packages from the official varnish-cache.org repos,
follow the instructions available at:

* https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish41/install

For manual installation instructions, use the instructions under "Manual" and
+select "rpm" for RPM-based distributions.

External packaging
------------------

Varnish Cache is also distributed in third party package repositories.
